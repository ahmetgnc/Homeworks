5)  -The first difference between View and materialized view is that In Views query result is not stored in the disk or database but Materialized view allow to store the query 
     result in disk or table.
    -Performance of View is less than Materialized view.
    -Last difference between View vs Materialized View is that In case of Materialized view we need an extra trigger or some automatic method so that we can keep MV refreshed,
     this is not required for views in the database.
